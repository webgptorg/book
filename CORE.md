## Organization

_(legacy name collection)_ group together workflows, workforce, knowledge, instruments, and actions into one package. Entities in one organization can share resources (= import resources from each other).

Each organization has unique URL, for example `https://promptbook.studio/my-cool-project/`.

## Workflow

Represents a piece of work that has exact imput and output.

Private pieces can be imported within the organization, public can be imported inside organization or used through unique url everywhere. Each workflow has unique URL, for example `https://promptbook.studio/my-cool-project/workflows/generate-website`.

As a programmer, you can imagine workflow as async function which can be used inside your code and exposes interface with record of input and record of output parameters but hides internal implementation.
