# Introduction

This document represents a preliminary version of a comparative analysis of tools and projects that can be considered competitors to Promptbook. It explores various dimensions and categories that we believe are significant in evaluating the capabilities and scope of these tools.

We recognize that new categories or dimensions may emerge as the field evolves, reflecting shifting priorities or previously unconsidered aspects of natural language programming and AI-native development. Additionally, the current list is by no means exhaustive, as this space is dynamic and rapidly growing.

One of the key goals of this analysis is to assess Promptbook’s fitness in the competitive landscape. By understanding its strengths relative to other projects, we aim to identify opportunities to partner with competing projects for strategic alliances, leveraging synergies to amplify impact and accelerate innovation.

# What is missing:

1. For the time being we do not treat AI agents systematiclly at all, for example. However, there are some exceptions like https://www.wordware.ai/ that declares to be a natural language IDE also for agents.
2. TODO: https://github.com/ruvnet/fireflies-webook
