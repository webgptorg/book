## General LLM / AI terms

_Note: Following is not complete dictionary, more list of general AI / LLM terms that has connection with Promptbook_

-   **Prompt drift** is a phenomenon where the AI model starts to generate outputs that are not aligned with the original prompt. This can happen due to the model's training data, the prompt's wording, or the model's architecture.
-   **Pipeline, workflow or chain** is a sequence of tasks that are executed in a specific order. In the context of AI, a pipeline can refer to a sequence of AI models that are used to process data.
-   **Fine-tuning** is a process where a pre-trained AI model is further trained on a specific dataset to improve its performance on a specific task.
-   **Zero-shot learning** is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform a task without any labeled examples. Instead, the model is provided with a description of the task and is expected to generate the correct output.
-   **Few-shot learning** is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform a task with only a few labeled examples. This is in contrast to traditional machine learning, where models are trained on large datasets.
-   **Meta-learning** is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained on a variety of tasks and is able to learn new tasks with minimal additional training. This is achieved by learning a set of meta-parameters that can be quickly adapted to new tasks.
-   **Retrieval-augmented generation** is a machine learning paradigm where a model generates text by retrieving relevant information from a large database of text. This approach combines the benefits of generative models and retrieval models.
