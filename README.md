## 📖 The Book Whitepaper

For most business applications nowadays, the biggest challenge isn't about the raw capabilities of AI models. Large language models like GPT-5 or Claude-4.1 are extremely capable.

The main challenge is to narrow it down, constrain it, set the proper **context, rules, knowledge, and personality**. There are a lot of tools which can do exactly this. On one side, there are no-code platforms which can launch your agent in seconds. On the other side, there are heavy frameworks like Langchain or Semantic Kernel, which can give you deep control.

Promptbook takes the best from both worlds. You are defining your AI behavior by simple **books**, which are very explicit. They are automatically enforced, but they are very easy to understand, very easy to write, and very reliable and portable.

### Aspects of great AI agent

We have created a language called **Book**, which allows you to write AI agents in their native language and create your own AI persona. Book provides a guide to define all the traits and commitments.

You can look at it as prompting (or writing a system message), but decorated by **commitments**.

#### `Persona` commitment

Personas define the character of your AI persona, its role, and how it should interact with users. It sets the tone and style of communication.

/>

#### `Knowledge` commitment

Knowledge Commitment allows you to provide specific information, facts, or context that the AI should be aware of when responding.

This can include domain-specific knowledge, company policies, or any other relevant information.

Promptbook Engine will automatically enforce this knowledge during interactions. When the knowledge is short enough, it will be included in the prompt. When it is too long, it will be stored in vector databases and RAG retrieved when needed. But you don't need to care about it.

/>

#### `Rule` commitment

Rules will enforce specific behaviors or constraints on the AI's responses. This can include ethical guidelines, communication styles, or any other rules you want the AI to follow.

Depending on rule strictness, Promptbook will either propagate it to the prompt or use other techniques, like adversary agent, to enforce it.

### Where to use your AI agent in book

Books can be useful in various applications and scenarios. Here are some examples:

#### Chat apps:

Create your own chat shopping assistant and place it in your eShop.
You will be able to answer customer questions, help them find products, and provide personalized recommendations. Everything is tightly controlled by the book you have written.

#### Reply Agent:

Create your own AI agent, which will look at your emails and reply to them. It can even create drafts for you to review before sending.

#### Coding Agent:

Do you love Vibecoding, but the AI code is not always aligned with your coding style and architecture, rules, security, etc.? Create your own coding agent to help enforce your specific coding standards and practices.

This can be integrated to almost any Vibecoding platform, like GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, Cursor, Cline, Kilocode, Roocode,...

They will work the same as you are used to, but with your specific rules written in book.

#### Internal Expertise

Do you have an app written in TypeScript, Python, C#, Java, or any other language, and you are integrating the AI.

You can avoid struggle with choosing the best model, its settings like temperature, max tokens, etc., by writing a book agent and using it as your AI expertise.

Doesn't matter if you do automations, data analysis, customer support, sentiment analysis, classification, or any other task. Your AI agent will be tailored to your specific needs and requirements.

Even works in no-code platforms!

## 📚 Dictionary

The following glossary is used to clarify certain concepts:

### General LLM / AI terms

-   **Prompt drift** is a phenomenon where the AI model starts to generate outputs that are not aligned with the original prompt. This can happen due to the model's training data, the prompt's wording, or the model's architecture.
-   [**Pipeline, workflow scenario or chain** is a sequence of tasks that are executed in a specific order. In the context of AI, a pipeline can refer to a sequence of AI models that are used to process data.](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/88)
-   **Fine-tuning** is a process where a pre-trained AI model is further trained on a specific dataset to improve its performance on a specific task.
-   **Zero-shot learning** is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform a task without any labeled examples. Instead, the model is provided with a description of the task and is expected to generate the correct output.
-   **Few-shot learning** is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform a task with only a few labeled examples. This is in contrast to traditional machine learning, where models are trained on large datasets.
-   **Meta-learning** is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained on a variety of tasks and is able to learn new tasks with minimal additional training. This is achieved by learning a set of meta-parameters that can be quickly adapted to new tasks.
-   **Retrieval-augmented generation** is a machine learning paradigm where a model generates text by retrieving relevant information from a large database of text. This approach combines the benefits of generative models and retrieval models.
-   **Longtail** refers to non-common or rare events, items, or entities that are not well-represented in the training data of machine learning models. Longtail items are often challenging for models to predict accurately.
