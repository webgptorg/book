## 📖 The Book Whitepaper

Nowadays, the biggest challenge for most business applications isn't the raw capabilities of AI models. Large language models such as GPT-5.2 and Claude-4.5 are incredibly capable.

The main challenge lies in **managing the context**, providing rules and knowledge, and narrowing the personality.

In Promptbook, you can define your context **using simple Books** that are very explicit, easy to understand and write, reliable, and highly portable.

<table style="border: 1px solid #777; border-radius: 10px;"><tr><td>

**<ins>Paul Smith</ins>**<br/>
<br/>
**PERSONA** You are a company lawyer.<br/>
Your job is to provide legal advice and support to the company and its employees.<br/>
**RULE** You are knowledgeable, professional, and detail-oriented.<br/>
TEAM You are part of the legal team of Paul Smith & Associés, you discuss with {Emily White}, the head of the compliance department. {George Brown} is expert in corporate law and {Sophia Black} is expert in labor law.<br/>

</td></tr></table>

### Aspects of great AI agent

We have created a language called **Book**, which allows you to write AI agents in their native language and create your own AI persona. Book provides a guide to define all the traits and commitments.

You can look at it as "prompting" _(or writing a system message)_, but decorated by **commitments**.

**Commitments** are special syntax elements that define contracts between you and the AI agent. They are transformed by Promptbook Engine into low-level parameters like which model to use, its temperature, system message, RAG index, MCP servers, and many other parameters. For some commitments _(for example `RULE` commitment)_ Promptbook Engine can even create adversary agents and extra checks to enforce the rules.

#### `Persona` commitment

Personas define the character of your AI persona, its role, and how it should interact with users. It sets the tone and style of communication.

<table style="border: 1px solid #777; border-radius: 10px;"><tr><td>

**<ins>Paul Smith & Associés</ins>**<br/>
<br/>
**PERSONA** You are a company lawyer.<br/>

</td></tr></table>

#### `Knowledge` commitment

Knowledge Commitment allows you to provide specific information, facts, or context that the AI should be aware of when responding.

This can include domain-specific knowledge, company policies, or any other relevant information.

Promptbook Engine will automatically enforce this knowledge during interactions. When the knowledge is short enough, it will be included in the prompt. When it is too long, it will be stored in vector databases and RAG retrieved when needed. But you don't need to care about it.

<table style="border: 1px solid #777; border-radius: 10px;"><tr><td>

**<ins>Paul Smith & Associés</ins>**<br/>
<br/>
**PERSONA** You are a company lawyer.<br/>
Your job is to provide legal advice and support to the company and its employees.<br/>
You are knowledgeable, professional, and detail-oriented.<br/>
<br/>
**KNOWLEDGE**  https://company.com/company-policies.pdf<br/>
**KNOWLEDGE** https://company.com/internal-documents/employee-handbook.docx<br/>

</td></tr></table>

#### `Rule` commitment

Rules will enforce specific behaviors or constraints on the AI's responses. This can include ethical guidelines, communication styles, or any other rules you want the AI to follow.

Depending on rule strictness, Promptbook will either propagate it to the prompt or use other techniques, like adversary agent, to enforce it.

<table style="border: 1px solid #777; border-radius: 10px;"><tr><td>

**<ins>Paul Smith & Associés</ins>**<br/>
<br/>
**PERSONA** You are a company lawyer.<br/>
Your job is to provide legal advice and support to the company and its employees.<br/>
You are knowledgeable, professional, and detail-oriented.<br/>
<br/>
**RULE** Always ensure compliance with laws and regulations.<br/>
**RULE** Never provide legal advice outside your area of expertise.<br/>
**RULE** Never provide legal advice about criminal law.<br/>
**KNOWLEDGE**  https://company.com/company-policies.pdf<br/>
**KNOWLEDGE** https://company.com/internal-documents/employee-handbook.docx<br/>

</td></tr></table>

#### `Team` commitment

Team commitment allows you to define the team structure and advisory fellow members the AI can consult with. This allows the AI to simulate collaboration and consultation with other experts, enhancing the quality of its responses.

<table style="border: 1px solid #777; border-radius: 10px;"><tr><td>

## 📚 Dictionary

The following glossary is used to clarify certain concepts:

### General LLM / AI terms

-   **Prompt drift** is a phenomenon where the AI model starts to generate outputs that are not aligned with the original prompt. This can happen due to the model's training data, the prompt's wording, or the model's architecture.
-   [**Pipeline, workflow scenario or chain** is a sequence of tasks that are executed in a specific order. In the context of AI, a pipeline can refer to a sequence of AI models that are used to process data.](https://github.com/webgptorg/promptbook/discussions/88)
-   **Fine-tuning** is a process where a pre-trained AI model is further trained on a specific dataset to improve its performance on a specific task.
-   **Zero-shot learning** is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform a task without any labeled examples. Instead, the model is provided with a description of the task and is expected to generate the correct output.
-   **Few-shot learning** is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained to perform a task with only a few labeled examples. This is in contrast to traditional machine learning, where models are trained on large datasets.
-   **Meta-learning** is a machine learning paradigm where a model is trained on a variety of tasks and is able to learn new tasks with minimal additional training. This is achieved by learning a set of meta-parameters that can be quickly adapted to new tasks.
-   **Retrieval-augmented generation** is a machine learning paradigm where a model generates text by retrieving relevant information from a large database of text. This approach combines the benefits of generative models and retrieval models.
-   **Longtail** refers to non-common or rare events, items, or entities that are not well-represented in the training data of machine learning models. Longtail items are often challenging for models to predict accurately.
