# ü§ç The Book <!-- Abstract -->

Great context and prompt can make or break you AI app. In last few years we have came from simple one-shot prompts. When you want to add conplexity you have finetunned the model or add better orchestration. But with really large large language models the context seems to be a king.

The Book is the language to describe and define your AI app. Its like a shem for a Golem, book is the shem and model is the golem.

```book

# Who, what and how?

To write a good prompt and the book you will be answering 3 main questions

-   **Who** is working on the task, is it a team or an individual? What is the role of the person in the team? What is the background of the person? What is the motivation of the person to work on this task?
    You rather want `Paul, an typescript developer who prefers SOLID code` not `gemini-2`
-   **What**
-   **How**

each commitment (described bellow) is connected with one of theese 3 questions.

## Commitments

Commitment is one piece of book, you can imagine it as one paragraph of book.

Each commitment starts in a new line with commitment name, its usually in UPPERCASE and follows a contents of that commitment. Contents of the commithemt is defined in natural language.

Commitments are chained one after another, in general commitments which are written later are more important and redefines things defined earlier.

Each commitment falls into one or more of cathegory who, what or how

Here are some basic commintemts:

-   `PERSONA` tells **who** is working on the task
-   `KNOWLEDGE`
-   `ACTION` **what** actions can be done
-   `RULE` describes
-   `STYLE` describes how

## Dynamic parameters

When the prompt nees to be usefull it should have some fixed static part and some variabible dynamic part

## Imports

## Layering

Book vs:

-   Why just dont pick the right model
-   Orchestration frameworks - Langchain, Google Agent ..., Semantic Kernel,...
-   Finetunning
-   Temperature, top_t, top_k,... etc.
-   System message
-   MCP server
-   function calling
