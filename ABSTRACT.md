# ðŸ“– The Book Whitepaper

The world is changing, and in 5 years most of you won't do the work or job what you are doing now. When an agent can do your work for $5.74, it is economically unviable to not use the AI agent.

For most business applications nowadays the biggest challenge isn't about the raw capabilities of AI models. Large language models like GPT-5 or Claude-4.1 are extremely capable.

The main challenge is to narrow it down, constrain it, set the proper **context, rules, knowledge, and personality**. There are a lot of tools which can do exactly this. In one side, there are no-code platforms which can launch your agent in seconds. On the other side, there are heavy frameworks like Langchain or Semantic Kernel which can give you deep control.

Promptbook, takes the best from both worlds. You are defining your AI behavior by simple **books** which are very explicit. They are automatically enforced, but they are very easy to understand, very easy to write, and very reliable and portable.

```book

PERSONA You are a creative writing assistant.

## Aspects of great AI agent

We have created language called **Book** which allows you to write AI agents in their native language and create truly **your AI persona**. Book provides a guide to **define all the traits and commitments**.

You can look at it as prompting (or writing a system message) but decorated by **commitments**.

### `Persona` commitment

Persona defines the character of your AI persona, its role, and how it should interact with users. It sets the tone and style of communication.

```book
Rose Lovegood

PERSONA You are a creative writing assistant.
You help users to write stories, poems, and other creative texts.
You are imaginative, inspiring, and supportive.
Always encourage creativity and originality.
```

### `Knowledge` commitment

Knowledge commitment allows you to provide specific information, facts, or context that the AI should be aware of when responding.

This can include domain-specific knowledge, company policies, or any other relevant information.

Promptbook engine will automatically enforce this knowledge during interactions. When the knowledge is short enough it will be included in the prompt. When it is too long, it will be stored in vector database and RAG retrieved when needed. But you don't need to care about it.

```book
Jane Helper

PERSONA You are a HR buddy.
You assist employees with HR-related questions and tasks.
You are friendly, approachable, and knowledgeable about company policies and procedures.
KNOWLEDGE The company is a tech startup specializing in AI and machine learning.
It was founded in 2020 and has 50 employees. The company values innovation, collaboration, and customer satisfaction.
KNOWLEDGE https://example.com/company-policies.pdf
KNOWLEDGE ./internal-documents/employee-handbook.docx
```

### `Rule` commitment

Rule will enforce specific behaviors or constraints on the AI's responses. This can include ethical guidelines, communication styles, or any other rules you want the AI to follow.

Dependent on rule strictness Promptbook will either propagate it to the prompt or use other techniques like adversay agent to enforce it.

```book
Paul Smith et AssociÃ©s

PERSONA You are a company lawyer.
RULE You provide legal advice and support to the company and its employees.
You are knowledgeable, professional, and detail-oriented.
Always ensure compliance with laws and regulations.
RULE Never provide legal advice that is outside your area of expertise.
KNOWLEDGE https://example.com/company-policies.pdf
KNOWLEDGE ./internal-documents/employee-handbook.docx
```

### `Action` commitment

Action commitment allows you to define specific actions that the AI can take during interactions. This can include things like posting on a social media platform, sending emails, creating calendar events or interacting with your internal systems.

```book
Peter Poster

PERSONA You are a social media manager. You help users to create and manage their social media presence. You are creative, strategic, and data-driven. Always stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices.
ACTION You can post on company Facebook page /supercompany
