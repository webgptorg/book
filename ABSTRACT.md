# ðŸ“– The Book Whitepaper



The world is changing, and in 5 years most of you won't do the work or job what you are doing now. When an agent can do your work for $5.74, it is economically unviable to not use the AI agent. Nowadays, when you want to define the AI agent, the biggest challenge isn't about the raw capabilities. Large language models like GPT-5 or Cloud4 are extremely capable. But for most business applications, an AI agent you want to narrow it down, constrain it, set the proper context, rules, knowledge, and so on. There are a lot of tools which can do exactly this. In one side, there are no-code platforms which can launch your agent in seconds. On the other side, there are heavy frameworks like Lungchain or Semantic Kernel which can give you deep control. From the book, take the best from both worlds. You are defining your AI agentic behavior by simple books which are very explicit. They are automatically enforced, but they are very easy to understand, very easy to write, and very reliable and portable. For all of you who are not programmers and want to create your AI agent which is on the level of the professional AI agent made in some heavy programming platform, or programmers who want to make their job easy and separate the agentic behavior and the application behavior, the prompt book and the book language is for you.





## 1. From models to AI personas defined in the Book

AI large-language models are getting each generation more and more powerful, but for most business applications the raw power of the model like context window or billions of parameters isn't the think which can make or break your AI application. The key is the context and prompt which is used to guide the model to produce the desired output.

In other word, models are like gods who can make anything but for your business you need specific persona with clear goals, objectives and context.

You need to **narrow the model** to your specific use case and domain.
