# ðŸ“– The Book Whitepaper

## 1. From models to AI personas defined in the Book

AI large-language models are getting each generation more and more powerful, but for most business applications the raw power of the model like context window or billions of parameters isn't the think which can make or break your AI application. The key is the context and prompt which is used to guide the model to produce the desired output.

In other word, models are like gods who can make anything but for your business you need specific persona with clear goals, objectives and context.

You need to **narrow the model** to your specific use case and domain.
