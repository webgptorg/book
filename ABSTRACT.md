# ðŸ“– The Book Whitepaper

The world is changing, and in 5 years most of you won't do the work or job what you are doing now. When an agent can do your work for $5.74, it is economically unviable to not use the AI agent.

For most business applications nowadays the biggest challenge isn't about the raw capabilities of AI models. Large language models like GPT-5 or Claude-4.1 are extremely capable.

The main challenge is to narrow it down, constrain it, set the proper **context, rules, knowledge, and personality**. There are a lot of tools which can do exactly this. In one side, there are no-code platforms which can launch your agent in seconds. On the other side, there are heavy frameworks like Langchain or Semantic Kernel which can give you deep control.

Promptbook, takes the best from both worlds. You are defining your AI behavior by simple **books** which are very explicit. They are automatically enforced, but they are very easy to understand, very easy to write, and very reliable and portable.

## Aspects of great AI agent

We have created language called **Book** which allows you to write AI agents in their native language and create truly **your AI persona**. Book provides a guide to **define all the traits and commitments**.

You can look at it as prompting (or writing a system message) but decorated by **commitments**.

### `Persona` commitment

Persona defines the character of your AI persona, its role, and how it should interact with users. It sets the tone and style of communication.
