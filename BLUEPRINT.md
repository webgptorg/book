## Basic concepts

Book is language for writing Promptbook pipelines in markdown format. It is designed to be easy to read and write. It is strict subset of markdown. It is designed to be understandable by both humans and machines and without specific knowledge of the language.

### Structure

Book is divided into sections. Each section starts with heading. The language itself is not sensitive to the type of heading _(`h1`, `h2`, `h3`, ...)_ but it is recommended to use `h1` for header section and `h2` for other sections.

### Header

Header is the first section of the book. It contains metadata about the pipeline. It is recommended to use `h1` heading for header section but it is not required.
