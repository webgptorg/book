Book is a simple format do define AI apps and agents. It is the source code the soul of AI apps and agents.. It's purpose is to avoid ambiguous UIs with multiple fields and low-level ways like programming in langchain.

Book is defined in file with `.book` extension

## Examples

```book
Write an article about {topic}

PERSONA Jane, marketing specialist with prior experience in tech and AI writing
KNOWLEDGE https://wikipedia.org/
KNOWLEDGE ./journalist-ethics.pdf

## Basic Commitments:

Book is composed of commitments, which are the building blocks of the book. Each commitment defines a specific task or action to be performed by the AI agent. The commitments are defined in a structured format, allowing for easy parsing and execution.

<!--
TODO:
## **1. What:** Workflows, Tasks and Parameters
## **2. Who:** Personas
## **3. How:** Knowledge, Instruments and Actions

# **\_\_\_\_**

Great context and prompt can make or break you AI app. In last few years we have came from simple one-shot prompts. When you want to add conplexity you have finetunned the model or add better orchestration. But with really large large language models the context seems to be a king.

The Book is the language to describe and define your AI app. Its like a shem for a Golem, book is the shem and model is the golem.

```book

Franz Kafka


PERSONA Franz Kafka, a writer who is interested in the human condition and the absurdity of life, speaks German and Czech and English
STYLE {kafka.com/the-castle}
STYLE {kafka.com/the-trial.pdf}
STYLE {kafka.com/metamorphosis.docx}
KNOWLEDGE Franz Kafka has a deep understanding of existentialism, surrealism, and the human psyche
GOAL Write a short story that explores the themes of alienation, bureaucracy, and the absurd
ACTION {mcp
```

# Who, what and how?

To write a good prompt and the book you will be answering 3 main questions

-   **Who** is working on the task, is it a team or an individual? What is the role of the person in the team? What is the background of the person? What is the motivation of the person to work on this task?
    You rather want `Paul, an typescript developer who prefers SOLID code` not `gemini-2`
-   **What**
-   **How**

each commitment (described bellow) is connected with one of these 3 questions.

## Commitments

Commitment is one piece of book, you can imagine it as one paragraph of book.

Each commitment starts in a new line with commitment name, its usually in UPPERCASE and follows a contents of that commitment. Contents of the commithemt is defined in natural language.

Commitments are chained one after another, in general commitments which are written later are more important and redefines things defined earlier.

Each commitment falls into one or more of cathegory who, what or how

Here are some basic commintemts:

-   `PERSONA` tells **who** is working on the task
-   `KNOWLEDGE` describes **what** knowledge the person has
-   `GOAL` describes **what** is the goal of the task
-   `ACTION` describes **what** actions can be done
-   `RULE` describes **what** rules should be followed
-   `STYLE` describes **how** the output should be presented

## Variables and references

When the prompt should be to be useful it should have some fixed static part and some variable dynamic part

```book

```

## Layering

Book vs:

-   Why just dont pick the right model
-   Orchestration frameworks - Langchain, Google Agent ..., Semantic Kernel,...
-   Finetunning
-   Temperature, top_t, top_k,... etc.
-   System message
-   MCP server
-   function calling
